# Deep-learning-specialization

Deep learning specialization offered by coursera is a fundamentall course in machine learning and AI. 

The following are a brief description of each task 

# 1. Deep neural network for image classification 

Build and trained a deep L- layer neural network from scratch and applyied it to supervised learning using cat/not a cat dataset 

# 2. Hyperparameter tuning (Initialization)

objective : choosing a better initialization for a new neural network by trying out a few different initializations, including random, zeros, and He initialization, 
and see how each leads to different results.

# Hyperparameter tuning (Regularization)

objective : Use a deep learning model with and without regularization techniques and note the difference between the two.
regularization techniques used : L2 regularization ,dropout 

# Hyperparemeter tuning( gradient checking) 

objective : build a deep learning model to detect fraud whenever someone makes a payment and if the payment is  fraudulent then check if the user's account 
has been taken over by a hacker.
gradient checking : it is used to confirm whether the backpropogation is working correctly or not .

# 3. Optimization methods 

objective : Apply optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp and Adam and use random minibatches to accelerate 
convergence and improve optimization . 

# 4. NN with tensor flow 

objective : build and train a neural network with the help of tensor flow library on a  " Hand sign data set ".
